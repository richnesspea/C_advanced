1. Why we need Dynamic Data Structure Linked List:
    * Problems with arrays:
        - fixed size: insufficient, dont know the number of elements required
        -> at runtime, the list size will be decided. At coding time or compiling time, we dont
    * Difference between array vs linked list
        - array: int A[5]: stored in stack
                            like a bench
        - linked list: int *p = new int[5]: pointer P is stored in stack and array is stored in heap
